**WARNING: DO NOT CONSUME THIS LIBRARY**

This library is a result of a [hlky sending a DMCA for 8 AGPL3 files](https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy) missing an unnecessary attribution (see AGPL3 Section 7b), instead of asking informally like a reasonable person.

As we cannot ensure that hlky won't abuse DMCA provisos again to fuel the vendeta they have against the AI Horde and violate the spirit of Free/Open Source software when it suits them, we cannot in good conscience suggest anyone else use this library.

This library has been created to externalize the files in question until we can replace them

Likewise, this library is rought extricated and only meant to be used in the context of hordelib
